### Abstract Factory Pattern for Notifications

## Problem Statement

You are working on a notification system for a communication application. The application must support different types of notifications, such as email, SMS, and push notifications. Each notification type has specific content and delivery methods. You want to design a flexible notification system where different types of notifications can be created without specifying their concrete classes, ensuring the system is open for future notification types and supports compatibility within families.

## Assignment

Your task is to implement the Abstract Factory pattern to create notifications and related components in the communication application. The Abstract Factory pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes, allowing for easy addition of new notification types and ensuring compatibility within families.

### Task 1 - Defining the Abstract Factory

The abstract factory class has been created for you. You will need to add the factory methods to create the notification, templates, and senders to the abstract factory class. The method `notificationType` has already been abstracted out for you as an example. You will need to implement the `NotificationFactory` class as a common parent class for all the notification factories.

### Task 2 - Implementing Concrete Factories

Create concrete implementations of the `NotificationFactory` interface for email and push notifications. Implement the methods to create compatible notifications, notification providers, and notification templates for each notification type. Ensure that the created components are compatible within the same family.

### Task 3 - Testing the Implementation

Run the provided test cases in the `NotificationFactoryTest` class to verify the correctness of your implementation. The tests will check if all notifications have a common parent class, and if the factory classes can correctly create notifications, notification providers, and notification templates based on the notification type and content.

### Instructions

1. Implement the `NotificationFactory` interface with methods to create notifications, notification providers, and notification templates.

2. Create concrete implementations of the `NotificationFactory` interface for email, SMS, and push notifications. Implement the methods to create compatible components for each notification type.

3. Run the provided test cases in the `NotificationFactoryTest` class to verify the correctness of your implementation. The tests will ensure that the factory classes can correctly create notification components based on the notification type and content.
