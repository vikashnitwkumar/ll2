1. Queue Initialization Issue
You are using a Queue<DatabaseConnection> for the connection pool (dbConnectionList), but it is not initialized anywhere. This will throw a NullPointerException when trying to add connections to it in initializePool().
Solution: Initialize the queue with a concrete class like ConcurrentLinkedQueue.

2. Concurrency Issues
Although you are using the Singleton design pattern, you're not properly managing the thread safety of the connection pool when multiple threads are requesting and releasing connections. In a production application, thread safety is important.
Solution: Use synchronized or better thread-safe data structures like ConcurrentLinkedQueue or ReentrantLock to ensure thread safety while retrieving and releasing connections.

3. Correct Management of Connection Availability
In your getConnection() method, you need to properly check if there is an available connection before returning it. You also need to handle the case when no connections are available.
Solution: You can implement a blocking mechanism or return null when no connections are available. A better approach would be to wait for a connection to be released (blocking).

4. Connection Availability Flag
Your DatabaseConnection class has a boolean available field. This is fine for simple scenarios, but it may not be thread-safe in highly concurrent systems.
Solution: Consider using an AtomicBoolean for available to ensure that the flag is updated atomically.
